# Work Distribution

Our method of communication during this project consisted of online and physical meetings. In our first meeting, we collaboratively searched for a dataset that met our project requirements. Once we selected the subject and dataset, we assigned roles to each team member. We also started discussing possible graphs that could be created to support the different perspectives.

After determining our roles, we began creating the graphs and developed a narrative around them. In the final week, we focused on refining the graphs and writing the story to ensure a cohesive and compelling final presentation.
