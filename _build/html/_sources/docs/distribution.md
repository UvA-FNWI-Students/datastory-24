# Work Distribution

Our method of communication during this project consisted of online and physical meetings. In our first meeting, we collaboratively searched for a dataset that met our project requirements. Once we selected the subject and dataset, we assigned roles to each team member. We also started discussing possible graphs that could be created to support the different perspectives.
After determining our roles, we began creating the graphs and developed a narrative around them. In the final week, we focused on refining the graphs and writing the story to ensure a cohesive and compelling final presentation.

_Julius_
Julius coordinated the project, ensuring all tasks were aligned and progressing as planned. He was primarily responsible for creating the plots and integrating all components into the website.

_Ingmar_
Ingmar assisted with the creation of the plots and took on the responsibility of writing the text for our narrative. His contributions were crucial in shaping the written component of our presentation.

_Hugo_
Hugo also assisted with the plot creation and shared the responsibility of writing the text alongside Ingmar. His input was vital in ensuring the narrative was clear and engaging.
Our project was a collaborative effort that required effective communication and division of labor. Each team member played a significant role in ensuring the successful completion of our project, from initial dataset selection to final presentation refinement. The combined efforts of Julius, Ingmar, and Hugo resulted in a comprehensive analysis and compelling narrative that we are proud to present.
