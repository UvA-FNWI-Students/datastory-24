# Introduction
In today's world people often believe the more money they can make safely, the happier they become. This is why many in the West strive for the best-paying jobs in our capitalist society to achieve economic freedom. People from the former Soviet Union don't share this near obsession and believe happiness comes from other places due to their communist past. This is one of the main ways Europe is still divided even after the Iron Curtain fell nearly 35 years ago.

This data story aims to determine whether financial protection correlates with happiness. We will use datasets from Kaggle, an online collection of datasets. The first dataset contains the Happiness Index and the second one is the Freedom Index of the World in 2019. They use multiple underlying variables to determine the ranking, which we will explore during our investigation.

In particular, we will explore the correlation between the happiness of a country and its financial legal protection.
