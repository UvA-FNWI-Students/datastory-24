# Reflection

### Peer Feedback

On June 20th, 2023, our team, N2, met with group N4 for a peer feedback session. During this meeting, each group took turns presenting the work they had accomplished over the past three weeks. After the presentation, the other group provided constructive feedback, highlighting strengths and suggesting areas for improvement.

We received many compliments for the plots, but we also received several suggestions for improvement. Below is a list of the feedback provided by group N4 and the TAs:

- Provide descriptions
- Ensure all indexes range from 1 to 10 or are consistent for the plot
- Publish the results on a website
- Make the plots larger
- Improve perspectives

### Self Reflection

We are really happy and proud of our end result. At the beginning, our team consisted of four people, but unfortunately, one member left the project after 1.5 weeks. Despite this setback, we quickly turned things around and continued working diligently. We found some excellent databases and began creating our plots.

Initially, our plots were of high quality, but we realized they weren't aligned with our intended perspectives, necessitating some adjustments and rework. This caused a slight delay in our schedule, but it did not affect the quality of our final results.
