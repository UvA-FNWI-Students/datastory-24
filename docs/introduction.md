# Introduction

In today’s free market economies of Europe it is important to have the appropriate legal systems in place to protect the rights of people and businesses alike. In western Europe these have had more time to slowly grow and improve whilst the former East Bloc has had way less time to develop since they were opened to capitalism almost 35 years ago. Studies show that the more legal protection people experience, the happier they are (D’Ambrioso et al., 2020). Others claim the happiness of people can be attributed to other factors. These factors, such as culture, region and climate would explain the different levels of happiness without having to mention legal protection. The stark difference between these perspectives is what we will explore in this data story.

To explore this contrast we will use 2 different datasets. One contains data about the happiness index of each country and the other contains the freedom indices. For this data story we will be looking at the data from 2019 and focused on Europe. We opted for this because Europe is unique in the way we have eastern countries who just recently opened their markets and are still in development while also having western countries who are fully developed over centuries. Another advantage is we share somewhat similar cultures and values so external factors are minimal.
