# Introduction

In today's world people often believe the more money they are able to make, the happier they become. This is why many in the West strive for the best paying jobs in our capitalist society to achieve economic freedom. People from the former Sovjet Union don't share this near obsession and believe happiness comes from other places due to their communist past. This is one of the main ways Europe is still devided even after the iron curtain has fallen nearly 35 years ago.

This data story aims to determine wether or not economic freedom does corrilate with happiness. For this we will use datasets from Kaggle, an online collection of datasets. The first dataset contains the Happiness Index and the second one the Freedom Index of the World in 2019. They use multiple underlying variables to make determine the ranking, which we will explore during our investigation.

In particular, we will explore the correlation between the happiness of a country and their different forms of economic freedom.
